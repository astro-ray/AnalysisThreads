# Analysis Threads
This is a collection of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) based on the [Fermi Analysis Threads](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/scitools/), step-by-step guides to various types of analyses that you can do with Fermi data.

## How To Use These Notebooks

Ensure that you have a conda environment that has the Fermitools set up properly. See the [Fermitools Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/fermi-lat/fermitools-conda) for more details. 

In your terminal and from within the `fermi` conda environment, do the following:

1. Download the notebook or notebooks you want to run. There are several ways to do this, including:
    - Navigating through the tree to the notebook you want and saving it to a file. 
    - Cloning this repository: `git clone https://github.com/fermi-lat/AnalysisThreads.git`
    - Using the green Code button on the repository main page to download a zip file with all the notebooks
1. In the terminal, go to the directory containing the notebooks.
1. Start the Jupyter Notebook server in your fermi conda environment with `jupyter notebook`
1. A web page should pop up with Jupyter Notebook interface running. 
1. Pick the analysis thread notebook of your choice and then run it.
