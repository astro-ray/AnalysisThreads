# Analysis Threads
This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks describing the Fermi Analysis Threads.

## How to use this tool
Ensure that you have a conda environment that has the fermitools set up properly. See the [Fermitools Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/fermi-lat/fermitools-conda) for more details. 

In your favorite terminal and from within the `fermi` conda environment, run the following (or the equivalent):

1. Clone this repository:
    - `git clone https://github.com/fermi-lat/AnalysisThreads.git`

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook server:
    - `jupyter notebook`

Make sure you are at least one directory above that of the analysis threads, otherwise Jupyter Notebook might not find them. 

A web page should pop up with Jupyter Notebook running. Run the analysis thread of choice, and you should be good to go!

Please submit issues as they come by!
