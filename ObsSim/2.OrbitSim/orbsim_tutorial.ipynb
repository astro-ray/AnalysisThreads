    "# Orbit Simulator Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "The FSSC Orbit Simulator, **gtorbsim**, is a spacecraft attitude calculator. It has a number of capabilities based on the code already implemented in the general purpose scheduling and planning system TAKO (Timeline Assembler Keyword Oriented) at the Fermi Science Support Center.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is anticipated, however, that the typical end user will only need a subset of the overall functionality of this tool. Primarily, a Guest Investigator would use it to generate a spacecraft data file to use in conjunction with gtobssim to simulate Fermi-LAT observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides some examples of how to run the **gtorbsim** application. This tool generates a spacecraft data file that is an input for some of the Fermitools. For example, the user may need to run this tool before running gtobssim in order to generate a simulated observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this simulator is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To calculate spacecraft attitude, that is where the local body frame axes are oriented relative to the sky\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To determine when events such as entry/exit in South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) will take place\n",
    "\n",
    "The above must be accomplished starting with a series of pointing commands. The output of the orbit simulator is a FITS spacecraft data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use the spacecraft data file provided by the FSSC, but in many cases you will probably need to generate that file if you want to perform a particular analysis of simulated data.\n",

    "# 1. Observation Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "The first input you will have to provide to gtorbsim is the observation mode strategy. Several operational modes are planned for Fermi, but the spacecraft will acquire scientific data only in survey and pointed modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sky survey mode** is basically zenith pointed throughout the orbit and has two sub modes: 1) with rocking, and 2) without rocking. Rocking provides more uniform sky coverage and allows for complete sky coverage within a shorter period of time. Different rocking profiles may be implemented, (square or sinusoid) with a basic 2-orbit period and a 60-degree maximum amplitude (above and below the orbit plane).\n",
    "\n",
    "In **pointed observation mode**, the Z-axis of the observatory is commanded to point at a celestial target.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the **gtorbsim** tool you may choose to calculate the attitude in survey or pointed mode. In survey mode you may choose between two options: fixed or profiled. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fixed survey mode the spacecraft does a sky survey with a specified offset with respect to its local zenith for one orbit, and then uses the opposite offset for the next orbit, and so on. In profiled survey, the spacecraft observes in survey mode according to a specified profile consisting of 17 increasing times and 17 zenith offsets. The 17 increasing times (in seconds) are used to indicate the time that it takes during each cycle to go from a corresponding zenith offset to the next. The 17 angles (in degrees) are the zenith offsets reached at the end of the corresponding time interval. The first and last of these offsets must be identical in order for the profile to be repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, in pointed mode the spacecraft stares at a specified location in the sky identified by an RA and DEC provided by the user. "

    "# 2. Spacecraft Ephemeris\n",
    "\n",
    " The orbit simulator needs to know the spacecraft position in the entire interval of interest in order to properly calculate the attitude, therefore it must be capable of either reading in a file that contains the spacecraft ephemeris, or to calculate one on the fly. The orbit simulator can handle three different types of ephemeris files:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Keep in mind that the Two Line Elements files are valid only for a few days. If the spacecraft data file that you may want to create is for a period of time where the ephemeris is not valid your spacecraft data file may not be accurate.\n",
